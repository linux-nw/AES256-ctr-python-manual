## AES256 Manual Implementation
This project contains a manual, from-scratch implementation of the AES-256 encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. Itâ€™s designed for educational purposes to deeply understand how AES works internally, without relying on external libraries.

## Features
1. Full AES-256 block cipher implementation
2. Key expansion and round transformations
3. Encrypt and decrypt 16-byte blocks
4. No external dependencies, pure Python

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run the Python script with your plaintext and key
3. See encrypted or decrypted output

## Notes
- This is not optimized for production or security-critical applications
- Purely for learning, experimentation, and cryptography study
- Inputs must be 16 bytes (128 bits) blocks
